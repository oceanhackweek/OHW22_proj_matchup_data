# Title
Matchup - Matching up data from moving platforms to remote sensing

# Specific tasks
+ Identify some use cases (it would be great to have at least one use case in each ocean!)
+ Identify sources of remote sensing data with coverage for the given matchup
+ Produce some recipes for matching up using a range of data sources for example ARGO floats to SST

# The problem
+ It is often desirable to add value to insitu measurements by augmenting them with satellite products such as SST and Ocean Color.

# Application example
+ Here is where you follow up with a location-specific example of where the data science methodology applies and list example datasets (size, format, how to access) that could be used for this exploration.

# Existing methods

## Proposed methods/tools
+ We propose developing recipes specific to desired data stores that fetch time and point coherent data from satellite archives.
